Key Insight
Ethereum's modular strategy has short-term price challenges but potentially significant long-term ecosystem advantages, with the approach designed to future-proof the network by attracting top developers and maintaining technological adaptability.

<list_of_important_information>
- Ethereum's price has underperformed Bitcoin and Solana, with ETH/BTC ratio down approximately 60% this cycle
- Modular strategy has reduced Ethereum's fee generation, which historically correlated strongly with token price
- The modular approach created economic opportunities for new infrastructure startups and L2 projects
- Ethereum's market share has declined from 100% to approximately 75%, but this is better performance than comparable web2 platforms like AWS
- Layer 2 solutions have been critical in maintaining Ethereum's relevance, preventing developers from migrating to alternative blockchain platforms
- Institutional interest remains strong in Ethereum, with organizations like Deutsche Bank, Coinbase, and BlackRock choosing Ethereum-based solutions
- Network effects remain powerful, with a strong correlation between user growth and token valuation (Metcalfe's Law)
- Prediction: Ethereum ecosystem tokens (including L2 tokens) may outperform Solana in the next cycle
- Venture capital deployment in crypto is expected to increase, potentially extending the current market cycle
