  "text": "Synopsis\nThe European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) is poised to transform the European crypto market, particularly in the stablecoin sector, by providing regulatory clarity and potentially positioning the EU as a global crypto innovation hub.\n\nKey Insights\n- MiCA went into force on December 30, 2024, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets\n- Currently, euro stablecoins represent less than 0.5% of global stablecoin circulation, despite the euro's 20-30% prominence in traditional financial markets\n- Key barriers to euro stablecoin adoption have been dollar-dominated liquidity, historical negative interest rates, and previous regulatory uncertainty\n- Circle has already launched EURC under MiCA-compliant conditions, experiencing 60-70% growth in supply\n- MiCA mandates stablecoin issuers hold reserves proportional to tokens circulating in the EU\n- Crypto exchanges are delisting USDT as trading pairs for EU customers under the new regulation\n- Potential use cases for euro stablecoins include regulated crypto capital markets and corporate cross-border payments\n- Real Economic Value (REV) in blockchain transactions has decreased from $2 billion in 2021 to about $700 million today, reflecting cheaper transaction costs and increased computational activity"
