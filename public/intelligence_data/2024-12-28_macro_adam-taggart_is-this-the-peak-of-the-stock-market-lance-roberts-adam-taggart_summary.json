  "text": "Key Insight\nThe stock market is at a potential peak, characterized by record high market exuberance, equity allocations, and investor confidence, which historically signals the end of a market cycle rather than the beginning of one.\n\nKey Insights\n- S&P 500 had a strong year, up 26-27% not including dividends\n- Earnings expectations for 2025 are $251 per share, which may be overly optimistic\n- Actual earnings for 2024 came in at $200 per share, significantly lower than initial estimates\n- Market valuations are currently at 22-25 times earnings, which is considered expensive\n- Household and professional investor equity allocations are at record levels\n- Consumer confidence in the market is at an all-time high\n- Senior population is more exposed to equities than ever before\n- Potential risks include:\n  - Potential earnings growth challenges\n  - Corporate debt refinancing wall\n  - Possible market correction of 10-20% in 2025\n  - Narrowing market breadth (most gains concentrated in few tech stocks)\n- Analysts are universally bullish, which is often a contrarian indicator\n- Two consecutive years of 20%+ returns are statistically rare (about 12% probability)\n"
