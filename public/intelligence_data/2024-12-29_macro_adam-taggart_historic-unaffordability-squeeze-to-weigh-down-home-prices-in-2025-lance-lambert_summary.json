  "text": "Key Insight\nThe US housing market is experiencing a historic affordability crisis, with potential for price corrections in overheated markets due to multiple converging factors including high mortgage rates, institutional selling, and reduced migration patterns.\n\nKey Insights\n- Housing affordability is at its second-worst level since the 1970s, with all-in costs (including property taxes and insurance) potentially at the worst level ever\n- Existing home sales are at their lowest levels since 1995, with over half of current homeowners unable to afford their homes at current mortgage rates\n- Institutional investors are becoming net sellers, particularly in Sun Belt and Mountain West markets\n- Short-term rental markets are experiencing corrections, with revenues declining for 14-16 months\n- Home builders are cutting prices and offering incentives to maintain sales volumes, drawing buyers away from existing home markets\n- Inventory is rising across most US markets, particularly in Sun Belt and Mountain West regions\n- Midwest and Northeast markets may see slight price increases in the short term but could experience sideways price movement\n- Potential economic risks include rising unemployment and increasing mortgage delinquencies\n- Immigration and potential policy changes could impact housing market dynamics\n- The labor market remains a key stabilizing factor for housing prices\n"
