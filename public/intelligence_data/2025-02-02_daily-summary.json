Massive US government deficits\n  2. Substantial corporate stock buyback programs\n  3. Declining reverse repo facility\n- Financial conditions have been consistently easing since October 2022, despite Federal Reserve's claims of restrictive policy\n- Potential market correction range estimated at 10-20%, which could realign valuations with historical norms\n- Market participants exhibit overwhelmingly bullish sentiment, with high retail equity exposure and low short interest\n\nOverarching Themes and Trends\n- Market cycle potentially extending to end of 2025 or Q1 2026, suggesting caution against premature exit from risk assets\n- Significant wealth inequality continues, with top 1% experiencing substantial wealth accumulation\n- Technical market divergences emerging, including:\n  1.
