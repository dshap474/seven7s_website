  "text": "Synopsis\nThe global economic landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation driven by generational shifts, with Millennials and Gen Z demanding economic fairness, potentially leading to significant changes in monetary policy, interest rates, and wealth distribution.\n\nKey Insights\n- The last 40 years of economic policy have concentrated wealth at the top, with approximately 1% of GDP growth annually going to the top 1% of earners\n- Millennials and Gen Z are experiencing significantly reduced wealth creation compared to Baby Boomers, with household formation at only 40-45% of previous generations\n- Structural economic pressures are building towards a demand for more equitable economic policies, driven by generational inequality\n- The term premium in bond markets suggests 10-year Treasury yields could reach 5.5-6%, significantly higher than current levels\n- Global refinancing demand is expected to peak in 2025, creating potential for significant capital market disruptions\n- The current economic system is likely to face increasing pressure to redistribute wealth and create more equitable economic opportunities\n- Populist political movements are emerging as a response to long-term economic inequality, transcending traditional left-right political divisions\n- The shift away from supply-side economics is likely to be a long-term, secular trend rather than a short-term phenomenon\n- Institutional constraints and existing economic structures may temporarily resist these changes, but generational demographic shifts make fundamental change increasingly inevitable"
