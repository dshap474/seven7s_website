  "text": "Synopsis\nCentral banks must fundamentally transform their approach during financial crises, moving from methodical price stability management to rapid, nuanced crisis response that requires unprecedented collaboration, communication, and strategic flexibility.\n\nKey Insights\n- Central banks face four critical differences when managing financial crises compared to normal economic conditions:\n  1. Speed of decision-making (rapid vs. gradual actions)\n  2. Complexity of understanding interconnected financial systems\n  3. Sophisticated, context-dependent communication strategies\n  4. Increased cooperation with government institutions\n\n- Non-bank financial sectors are increasingly likely sources of future financial crises, not traditional banking systems\n\n- Deposit insurance schemes are fundamentally flawed, often providing de facto unlimited guarantees despite official limits\n\n- Tariffs are economically counterproductive, potentially:\n  1. Fragmenting global economic relationships\n  2. Increasing economic uncertainty\n  3. Not effectively solving trade deficits\n  4. Potentially damaging long-term economic growth\n\n- Crisis management requires central banks to:\n  1. Anticipate potential scenarios\n  2. Develop multiple contingency plans\n  3. Maintain flexibility in response strategies\n  4. Communicate carefully to prevent market panic\n\n- Emerging financial crises are becoming more complex, often involving broader economic confidence issues beyond traditional banking failures"
