  "text": "Synopsis\nio.net's founder Tory Green identifies a critical market inefficiency in cloud computing, where major tech companies monopolize compute resources, creating an opportunity for decentralized networks to disrupt the multi-trillion dollar infrastructure market.\n\nKey Insights\n- In 2016, Green discovered crypto and saw its potential to solve systemic problems in technology infrastructure\n- Major tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) monopolize the entire value chain from compute to data to models\n- These companies restrict access to equipment and lock users into long-term contracts\n- Startups were spending approximately 80% of raised capital on AI compute, which Green viewed as unsustainable\n- Green believes decentralized networks represent a \"once in a generation opportunity\" to solve compute resource challenges\n- The core problem is the restrictive and expensive compute resource market controlled by tech giants\n- Decentralized networks are positioned as a potential solution to break the current compute resource monopoly"
