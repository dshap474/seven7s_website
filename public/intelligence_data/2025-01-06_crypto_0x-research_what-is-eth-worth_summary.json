  "text": "Synopsis\nThe current valuation of Ethereum (ETH) is difficult to justify rationally, with its $400 billion market cap appearing overvalued when analyzed through various investment lenses, suggesting Bitcoin remains a more sound store of value investment.\n\nKey Insights\n- Ethereum processed $744 billion in stablecoin volumes in December, with $378 billion in USDC and $366 billion in USDT\n- John Pfeffer's 2017 thesis predicted Bitcoin as the likely dominant crypto store of value, with a potential market cap of $4.7 to $14.6 trillion\n- Ethereum's scaling solutions (L2s and proof-of-stake) are seen as bullish for adoption but potentially bearish for token value\n- Triton liquid fund analysis suggests Ethereum's onchain \"GDP\" is only about $2.8 billion, making its $400 billion valuation approximately 1000x overvalued\n- The strongest argument for ETH is as an internet-native commodity that can be staked for yield, but the 3% yield from Lido may not offset its inherent volatility\n- Degen capital remains crucial to crypto markets, driving initial bootstrapping of ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and various L2 platforms"
