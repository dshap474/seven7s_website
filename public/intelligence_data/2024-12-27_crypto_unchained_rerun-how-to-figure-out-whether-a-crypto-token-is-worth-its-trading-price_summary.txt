- Venture capitalists and early investors often have unrealized gains 4-8 times the current market capitalization of tokens
- The current token distribution model tends to concentrate value with insiders, with early investors and teams having low-cost basis tokens
- Secondary markets for tokens are often illiquid, with many tokens having no meaningful bids even at significant discounts
- The market is experiencing a cycle where smart money is trying to exit quickly before potential market corrections
- Potential solutions include longer vesting periods, more transparent token economics, and potentially reviving initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a more regulated manner
- The crypto market is still struggling to create meaningful utility and use cases for many tokens beyond speculation
