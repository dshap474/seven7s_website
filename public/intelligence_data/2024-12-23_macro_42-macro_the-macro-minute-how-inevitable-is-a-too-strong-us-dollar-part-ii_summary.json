Widening interest rate differentials\n  2. Potential implementation of tariffs\n- A significant $700-800 billion Treasury General Account (TGA) spend-down is anticipated in early 2025\n- This TGA spend-down could temporarily:\n  - Weaken the dollar\n  - Support risk assets through late Q1 or early Q2 2025\n- Subsequent TGA replenishment may create a global refinancing \"air pocket\"\n- The incoming Treasury Secretary (Scott Bessent) is expected to shift US net financing policy\n- The Federal Reserve is implementing \"Fake QT\" by allowing maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet without actively selling bonds\n- This approach has contributed to:\n  - A more resilient economy\n  - Buoyant asset prices\n  - Maintained labor market strength\n"
