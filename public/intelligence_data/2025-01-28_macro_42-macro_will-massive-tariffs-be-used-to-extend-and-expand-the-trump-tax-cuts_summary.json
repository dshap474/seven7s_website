  "text": "Synopsis\nCongressional Republicans are likely to use massive tariffs and spending cuts to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts, potentially triggering a stock market crash in 2025 due to liquidity drainage and US dollar strength.\n\nKey Insights\n- The Trump tax cuts' individual income tax portions are set to expire on December 31st\n- Congressional reconciliation process will be used to implement the tax cut extension\n- The Senate's \"bird rule\" requires budget neutrality beyond 10 years\n- Fresh tariffs will be used to generate revenue to offset tax cut extensions\n- Significant tariff increases could potentially cause a stock market crash in 2025\n- The primary risk is not the tariffs themselves, but the potential liquidity drain and US dollar strength\n- The market crash risk is heightened by peak global debt refinancing demand and potential changes in Treasury net financing policy"
