Global economic growth is at risk due to declining population growth rates across most regions, which will create significant challenges for GDP expansion, debt management, and economic sustainability.


<list_of_important_information>
- Population growth is collapsing across Western World and Southeast Asia, with only Middle East and Africa maintaining higher birth rates
- GDP growth is driven by three key factors: population growth, productivity growth, and debt growth
- Aging populations are making debt management increasingly difficult
- Immigration, traditionally a solution for population decline, is becoming politically challenging in Europe
- Countries like Australia have successfully used immigration (at around 3% rate) to sustain economic growth
- Economic adaptation strategies include:
  1. Generating internal economic growth
  2. Importing new workers
  3. Exporting products
  4. Developing value-added economic sectors
- Cultural and assimilation challenges are significant barriers to immigration-based population growth strategies
