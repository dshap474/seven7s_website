  "text": "Synopsis\nThe SEC faces judicial criticism for its arbitrary and inconsistent approach to crypto regulation, with courts challenging the agency's enforcement strategy against crypto firms without clear compliance guidelines.\n\nKey Insights\n- A federal appeals court ruled that the SEC's order denying Coinbase's petition for rulemaking was \"conclusory and insufficiently reasoned\"\n- Judge Stephanos Bibas argued that the SEC's sporadic enforcement against crypto firms risks de facto banning the entire industry\n- The court did not mandate rulemaking but asked the SEC to provide a more substantive explanation of its regulatory approach\n- This follows a similar court decision against the SEC in the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF case, where the agency was found to be \"arbitrary and capricious\"\n- Coinbase executives view this as a partial victory in their ongoing legal battle with the SEC\n- Grayscale research suggests optimal bitcoin portfolio allocation is around 5%, with diminishing returns beyond that point\n- Bloomberg reports suggest a potential Trump administration approach of gradual tariff increases (2-5% per month)\n- Producer Price Index (PPI) for December showed a mild 0.2% rise, slightly below analyst expectations\n- Bitcoin rebounded to near $97,000, while US spot bitcoin ETFs experienced approximately $1 billion in net outflows"
