  "text": "Synopsis\nThe crypto industry lacks standardized data metrics, with current approaches to measuring blockchain value and user activity fundamentally flawed, necessitating a more nuanced approach to understanding blockchain economics.\n\nKey Insights\n- Current blockchain revenue metrics are misleading, as blockchains are networks, not businesses, making it difficult to accurately define \"revenue\"\n- Introduced \"Rev\" (Revenue) metric, which captures total user-paid value for transaction execution across blockchain networks\n- Active addresses are an unreliable metric due to:\n  - Easy creation of multiple wallets\n  - Prevalence of bot farms and airdrop farming\n  - Inability to distinguish between unique users and automated systems\n- Solana demonstrates significant network activity, generating $1.4 billion in total network revenue in 2024\n- Multicoin Capital proposed a new inflation reduction mechanism for Solana:\n  - Implement a target stake rate of 50%\n  - Dynamically adjust inflation based on total staked tokens\n  - Currently, stakers earn 97% of inflation, with validators taking 3%\n- Base (Coinbase's Layer 2) accounts for approximately 80% of Ethereum L2 transaction fees\n- Ethereum has deprioritized L1 execution in favor of an L2 roadmap, potentially impacting its value proposition\n- Major crypto acquisitions in payment space: Moonpay acquired Helio, Chainalysis acquired Altera (both around $150-175 million)"
