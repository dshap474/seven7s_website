  "text": "Synopsis\nEthereum faces significant challenges in establishing its value proposition, with potential salvation lying in ETF flows and institutional ignorance about alternative smart contract platforms, while struggling to define a clear narrative between \"world computer\" and store of value.\n\nKey Insights\n- Ethereum's revenue from Layer 2 networks is minimal, with Base generating $30 million in Q4 2024, of which Ethereum received only $2 million\n- Ethereum ETFs have already accumulated more ETH in six months than all Layer 2 networks combined\n- L2 networks like Base are increasingly abstracting ETH away from user transactions, using stablecoins like USDC for gas fees\n- Ethereum is planning incremental improvements in Pectra upgrade, including increasing blob limits from 3 to 6\n- Competing platforms like Celestia offer significantly cheaper data availability (90% cheaper) with higher potential throughput\n- Major institutions are largely unaware of alternative smart contract platforms, potentially benefiting Ethereum\n- ETF flows represent a potential catalyst for Ethereum's valuation, with growing passive investment interest\n- The platform struggles to define a clear narrative between being a \"world computer\" and a store of value asset\n- Native rollup solutions remain a potential future development, but face community and technical challenges"
