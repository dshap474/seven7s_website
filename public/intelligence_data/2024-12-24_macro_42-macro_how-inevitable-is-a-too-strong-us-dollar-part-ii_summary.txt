Key Insight
The US dollar is likely to remain strong in the medium term due to widening interest rate differentials and potential policy changes, with a significant Treasury General Account spend-down potentially creating a global refinancing challenge.


<list_of_important_information>
- Multiple factors are expected to support the current US dollar uptrend, including:
  1. Widening interest rate differentials
  2. Potential implementation of tariffs
- A projected $700-$800 billion Treasury General Account (TGA) spend-down is anticipated in early next year
- The TGA spend-down could be dollar-bearish and support risk assets through late Q1 or early Q2
- Subsequent TGA replenishment may create a global refinancing "air pocket" with limited dollar balance sheet capacity
- Potential shifts in US net financing policy under incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
