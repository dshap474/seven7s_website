  "text": "Synopsis\nThe US economy is likely to experience a growth scare in the first half of 2025, driven by housing market deterioration and potential job losses in construction, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively than currently anticipated.\n\nKey Insights\n- Warren Pies predicts a growth scare in Q1-Q2 2025, primarily triggered by housing market deterioration\n- Residential construction employment is expected to decline, with an estimated 75,000 excess jobs in the sector\n- Housing market indicators suggest stress: completed unsold inventory has increased, and time-to-complete for construction projects has normalized\n- Mortgage rates around 7% are viewed as unsustainable for the housing market\n- The Federal Reserve's December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) shifted to a more hawkish stance, reducing expected rate cuts for 2025\n- Shelter inflation is expected to cool between January and March 2025, contributing to overall disinflation\n- Pies anticipates the Fed will ultimately cut rates 3-4 times in 2025, more than the current market consensus\n- Equity markets are not considered in a bubble, with potential for modest multiple expansion due to the market's composition of mature, high-quality tech companies\n- Long-term bond yields are expected to average 4% in 2025, with potential for further bond market opportunities\n- Gold is predicted to reach $3,000 per ounce in 2025"
