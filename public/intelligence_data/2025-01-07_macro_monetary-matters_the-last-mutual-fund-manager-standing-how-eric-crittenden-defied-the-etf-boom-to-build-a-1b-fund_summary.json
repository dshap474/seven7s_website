  "text": "Synopsis\nEric Crittenden's Standpoint Asset Management demonstrates that a systematic, globally diversified investment strategy focusing on liquid futures markets and uncorrelated assets can successfully navigate complex market environments, challenging traditional investment approaches.\n\nKey Insights\n- Standpoint has grown to over $1 billion in assets under management within five years by targeting small to medium-sized financial advisors in mid-sized cities\n- The fund uses a unique \"all-weather investing\" approach, combining global macro trend following, equities, and fixed income across 75 most liquid futures markets\n- Key investment philosophy emphasizes diversification, systematic trading, and the ability to make psychologically difficult trades based on quantitative signals\n- The fund deliberately chose a mutual fund structure over ETFs due to global market trading complexities and greater flexibility\n- Capacity for the strategy is estimated at approximately $12 billion without changing the current approach\n- The strategy is open interest weighted, focusing on the most liquid markets rather than obscure, smaller futures markets\n- Current market environment suggests low-probability, high-impact investment opportunities may emerge, requiring sophisticated diversification strategies\n- The fund maintains a global equity exposure, deliberately avoiding concentration in US markets despite recent outperformance\n- Systematic approach allows trading against market sentiment, such as shorting energy markets in 2020 and bonds in 2022 when such moves were psychologically difficult\n- The investment strategy prioritizes long-term wealth preservation over short-term performance"
