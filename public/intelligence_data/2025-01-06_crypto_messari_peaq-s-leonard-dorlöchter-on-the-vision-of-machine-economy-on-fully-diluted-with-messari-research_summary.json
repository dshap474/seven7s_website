  "text": "Synopsis\nPeaq is a blockchain project focused on creating a decentralized machine economy where various machines can autonomously transact with each other, with roots tracing back to a 2017 vision of blockchain and IoT integration.\n\nKey Insights\n- Peaq was founded in 2017 by three co-founders: Max, Leonard Dorlöchter, and Till\n- The project originated from an interest in Ethereum and decentralized applications\n- Core vision is to enable a machine economy where different types of machines (cars, charging stations, drones, robots) can transact independently\n- Founders were particularly impressed by the intersection of blockchain technology and Internet of Things (IoT)\n- The project aims to create an open system for machine-to-machine transactions\n- The original vision from 2017 remains fundamentally unchanged, though the project has likely evolved"
