  "text": "Synopsis\nUS banking regulators appear to have systematically targeted crypto-focused banks like Silvergate, effectively implementing an unofficial policy to restrict crypto's access to the traditional banking system through coordinated regulatory pressure.\n\nKey Insights\n- Silvergate Bank, a crypto-focused bank, was forced into voluntary liquidation after experiencing massive deposit withdrawals following the FTX collapse\n- Banking regulators reportedly suggested banks should limit crypto-related business to 15% of total operations, which was effectively impossible for Silvergate\n- Regulators did not provide clear, written guidelines, making the restrictions difficult to challenge\n- Short sellers allegedly spread false narratives about Silvergate, potentially exacerbating market uncertainty\n- The bank maintained full liquidity and did not lose any depositor funds during its wind-down\n- Mike Lmis, former Silvergate chairman, believes this was a coordinated effort from Washington DC to \"choke out\" crypto banking\n- The actions against Silvergate and Signature Bank led to 1,700 crypto companies losing their bank accounts\n- The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) was primarily valuable due to its network of crypto companies, not its underlying technology\n- The regulatory approach appears to be part of a broader strategy to limit crypto's integration with traditional banking infrastructure\n- The US is now behind other global markets in responsible crypto banking regulation"
