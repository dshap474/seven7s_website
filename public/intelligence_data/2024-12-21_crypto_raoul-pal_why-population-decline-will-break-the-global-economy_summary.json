  "text": "Key Insight\nGlobal economic growth is at risk due to declining population growth rates across most regions, which will create significant challenges for GDP expansion, debt management, and economic sustainability.\n\nKey Insights\n- Population growth is collapsing across Western World and Southeast Asia, with only Middle East and Africa maintaining higher birth rates\n- GDP growth is driven by three key factors: population growth, productivity growth, and debt growth\n- Aging populations are making debt management increasingly difficult\n- Immigration, traditionally a solution for population decline, is becoming politically challenging in Europe\n- Countries like Australia have successfully used immigration (at around 3% rate) to sustain economic growth\n- Economic adaptation strategies include:\n  1. Generating internal economic growth\n  2. Importing new workers\n  3. Exporting products\n  4. Developing value-added economic sectors\n- Cultural and assimilation challenges are significant barriers to immigration-based population growth strategies\n- Declining birth rates are a global trend, with countries like Bangladesh rapidly transitioning from high to low fertility rates\n- Economic models will need fundamental restructuring to address population decline challenges\n"
