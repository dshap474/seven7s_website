  "text": "Synopsis\nThe crypto market is experiencing a growing perception of unfairness, with token launches increasingly favoring insiders and key opinion leaders (KOLs), which could potentially discourage broader retail investor participation.\n\nKey Insights\n- The AICC crypto token experienced an unprecedented 100,000% price increase immediately after launch\n- The token was primarily distributed through an invite-only \"party round\" to key opinion leaders (KOLs)\n- A public dashboard exposed the participants of the token's initial distribution, creating transparency and controversy\n- The token launch mirrors historical issues in traditional financial markets, such as the IPO practices during the dotcom era\n- The perceived unfairness of such token launches may be damaging to the crypto ecosystem's credibility and future investment potential\n- The social media backlash against the AICC token launch potentially contributed to a selloff in AI-related crypto tokens\n- Historical precedent from Wall Street suggests that perceived insider trading and unfair allocation can erode market confidence"
