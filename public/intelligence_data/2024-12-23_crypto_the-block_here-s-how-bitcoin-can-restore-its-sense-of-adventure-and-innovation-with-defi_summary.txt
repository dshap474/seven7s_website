Key Insight
Bitcoin is poised to become a foundational, generalized compute system that could unlock trillions of dollars in assets by moving complex computations off-chain through ZK proofs, transforming from a limited digital gold to a comprehensive global settlement layer.


<list_of_important_information>
- Bitcoin OS is developing a smart contract platform that enables complex computations to be verified and executed on Bitcoin through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs
- The approach moves computational complexity off-chain while using Bitcoin as a secure, immutable settlement layer
- Potential market opportunity includes approximately $2-6 trillion in Bitcoin assets currently seeking productive deployment
- AI agents are expected to become major financial actors, preferring platforms with strong network effects and reliable infrastructure
- Anticipated developments in 2025 include:
  - Bitcoin rollups
  - Programmable tokens
  - Decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin
  - More institutional-grade NFTs and DAOs
- The strategy aims to make Bitcoin a generalized compute system without requiring changes to Bitcoin's core protocol
- Competing blockchain platforms are likely to pivot to becoming execution environments for Bitcoin rather than standalone ecosystems
- The approach addresses scalability and user experience challenges by leveraging ZK cryptography and off-chain computation
