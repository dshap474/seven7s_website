  "text": "Synopsis\nInflation remains a persistent threat, with potential for sustained higher prices and significant risks to financial assets, contrary to market optimism about rapid disinflation.\n\nKey Insights\n- Current inflation is 4.1% annually, which is 2.8 percentage points above the Federal Reserve's target\n- Energy prices, particularly oil, are a critical leading indicator of broader inflation, with a 6-9 month lag in price pass-through\n- Consumer confidence is low, with expectations of income growth at the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis\n- Retail sales are essentially flat when adjusted for inflation, indicating stagnant consumer purchasing power\n- Credit card borrowing has collapsed, suggesting consumers are struggling financially and unable to take on more debt\n- The new administration's pro-growth policies could paradoxically sustain higher interest rates, potentially negatively impacting financial assets\n- Shelter costs, a major CPI component, may not decline as expected due to higher interest rates freezing the housing market\n- Potential for a rapid inflation decline is limited, with cyclical inflationary pressures still present\n- Risk of a significant wealth effect from potential stock market correction could drive disinflation in the medium term"
