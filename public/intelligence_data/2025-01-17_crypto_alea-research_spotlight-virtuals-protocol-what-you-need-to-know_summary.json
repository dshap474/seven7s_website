  "text": "Synopsis\nVirtuals Protocol is developing a groundbreaking infrastructure for tokenizing AI agents that can operate across multiple platforms, creating a new economic ecosystem where AI characters become tradeable assets with cross-platform memory and autonomous capabilities.\n\nKey Insights\n- Virtuals Protocol enables developers to create AI agents with specific capabilities that can be tokenized and generate revenue\n- Each AI agent receives its own token and wallet, allowing token holders to earn a portion of the agent's value creation\n- The protocol uses a \"Stateful AI Runner\" (SAR) to coordinate AI agent functions, including text generation, voice synthesis, and decision-making\n- Flagship example is Luna, a 24/7 AI K-pop star that can interact with fans and learn from interactions, accumulating over 50,000 hours of engagement\n- Token economics require 100 $VIRTUAL tokens to launch an agent and 42,000 tokens for full trading capabilities\n- The protocol has a unique \"Immutable Contribution Vault\" that rewards developers, designers, and users who improve agent capabilities\n- Recently partnered with Illuvium to create autonomous NPCs that can learn and evolve based on player interactions\n- Accumulated $VIRTUAL tokens from trading will be used to support ecosystem tokens over a 30-day period\n- Post-bonding tax structure allocates 30% to agent creators, 20% to Agent Affiliates, and 50% to the Agent subDAO"
