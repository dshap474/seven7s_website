  "text": "Synopsis\nHumanity Protocol is emerging as a significant decentralized identity project targeting human verification in the blockchain ecosystem, positioning itself as a potential competitor to World by offering a more practical palm-scanning biometric authentication approach.\n\nKey Insights\n- Humanity Protocol raised $1.1B at a fully diluted valuation (FDV), with investments from Pantera Capital and Jump Crypto\n- The project aims to create a sybil-resistant blockchain using palm scan recognition technology for human authentication\n- Currently has over 3.2 million users on its testnet, onboarding tens of thousands of users daily\n- Differentiates from World (another identity verification project) by using palm scanning instead of iris scanning, which is perceived as more practical and less invasive\n- Introduces \"Proof-of-Humanity\" mechanism that allows applications to authenticate users and prevent bot interactions\n- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify user credentials while maintaining privacy\n- Developing integrations with OKX Wallet and Kaito, with plans to expand user base\n- Users can currently earn $RWT rewards through testnet activities, which will be exchangeable for the native protocol token upon mainnet launch\n- Positioned to address growing concerns about AI-generated content and the need for human verification in digital ecosystems"
