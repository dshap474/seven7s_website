  "text": "Synopsis\nBitcoin's four-year market cycles are driven by the halving event, which systematically reduces mining output and creates upward price pressure through constrained supply.\n\nKey Insights\n- Bitcoin experiences predictable four-year market cycles tied to the halving event\n- Miners consistently sell newly mined Bitcoin to fund operational expenses (hardware, electricity)\n- Each halving cuts Bitcoin production by approximately 50%\n- Reduced supply combined with constant demand creates upward price momentum\n- The amplitude of these market cycles is moderating with each successive cycle\n- The current market cycle suggests potential for Bitcoin to reach all-time high prices around $100,000"
