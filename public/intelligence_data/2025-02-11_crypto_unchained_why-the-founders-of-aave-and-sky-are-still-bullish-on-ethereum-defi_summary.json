  "text": "Synopsis\nThe future of decentralized finance (DeFi) is increasingly intertwined with artificial intelligence, with Ethereum remaining the primary ecosystem for innovative blockchain development despite emerging competition from networks like Solana.\n\nKey Insights\n- Aave and Sky (formerly Maker) are focusing on simplifying DeFi user experiences while maintaining complex backend infrastructure\n- Ethereum remains the most robust ecosystem for DeFi development, with superior tooling and developer infrastructure\n- Solana is gaining momentum, particularly through meme coin activity, but has not yet matched Ethereum's scale and economic inertia\n- AI is expected to play a transformative role in DeFi, potentially driving:\n  - Capital allocation\n  - Risk parameter adjustments\n  - Governance optimization\n  - More efficient financial decision-making\n- Both Aave and Sky are preparing their protocols for AI integration, with emphasis on structured data and automated governance\n- The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has not yet recovered to 2021 peak levels, suggesting ongoing market maturation\n- Institutional interest in tokenization and on-chain assets is expected to drive future DeFi growth\n- Ethereum's multi-layer strategy (main net and L2s) provides flexibility for future development"
