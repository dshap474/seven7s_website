  "text": "Key Insight\nBitcoin is poised to become a foundational, generalized compute system that could unlock trillions of dollars in assets by moving complex computations off-chain through ZK proofs, transforming from a limited digital gold to a comprehensive global settlement layer.\n\nKey Insights\n- Bitcoin OS is developing a smart contract platform that enables complex computations to be verified and executed on Bitcoin through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs\n- The approach moves computational complexity off-chain while using Bitcoin as a secure, immutable settlement layer\n- Potential market opportunity includes approximately $2-6 trillion in Bitcoin assets currently seeking productive deployment\n- AI agents are expected to become major financial actors, preferring platforms with strong network effects and reliable infrastructure\n- Anticipated developments in 2025 include:\n  - Bitcoin rollups\n  - Programmable tokens\n  - Decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin\n  - More institutional-grade NFTs and DAOs\n- The strategy aims to make Bitcoin a generalized compute system without requiring changes to Bitcoin's core protocol\n- Competing blockchain platforms are likely to pivot to becoming execution environments for Bitcoin rather than standalone ecosystems\n- The approach addresses scalability and user experience challenges by leveraging ZK cryptography and off-chain computation\n"
