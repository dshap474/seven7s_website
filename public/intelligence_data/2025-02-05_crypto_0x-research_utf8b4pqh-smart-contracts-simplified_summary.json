  "text": "Synopsis\nHyperweb is developing a JavaScript-native blockchain ecosystem aimed at bridging Web2 and Web3 development by simplifying smart contract creation and enabling cross-chain execution, potentially attracting more developers to the blockchain space.\n\nKey Insights\n- Hyperweb has secured $5 million in funding and is building on Cosmos tooling to create a universal JavaScript virtual machine (HVM)\n- The project aims to allow developers to write smart contracts in TypeScript, avoiding the learning curve of Solidity, Rust, or Move\n- Hyperweb is exploring a proof-of-authority (PoA) model instead of traditional proof-of-stake, criticizing current Cosmos chain tokenomics as \"broken\"\n- The project plans to integrate Ethereum, Solana, and other non-Cosmos chains for universal smart contract execution\n- Fees will be denominated in Noble USDC, with the native token functioning as a revenue-sharing mechanism\n- A local net is already launched, with a public testnet coming soon\n- Ethereum's total circulating supply has returned to pre-Merge levels of 120.5 million, no longer being deflationary due to declining network usage and L2 shifts\n- Story Protocol is bringing intellectual property onchain, with a recent example of Justin Bieber's \"Peaches\" song being tokenized as a real-world asset"
