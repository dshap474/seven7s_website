  "text": "Synopsis\nThe future of finance lies in a crypto-native, globally accessible financial system with unified servers, which can dramatically improve capital allocation, property rights, and economic opportunities for emerging markets by reducing friction and increasing transparency.\n\nKey Insights\n- Current financial systems are fragmented across 90,000 disparate, permissioned servers, creating inefficiencies in capital movement\n- Emerging markets lose approximately 65% of purchasing power relative to USD over 15 years due to local currency devaluation\n- Property rights scores for emerging markets average around 49 (versus 95 for US/Europe), limiting economic development\n- Crypto's unified, permissionless server architecture enables:\n  - Free flow of global capital\n  - Stronger property rights\n  - More financial service innovation\n  - Compressed net interest margins\n  - Potential for faster GDP growth\n- Stable coins and on-chain US assets provide emerging market citizens access to more stable financial instruments\n- Potential for a \"vampire attack\" where US financial assets can be made globally accessible, benefiting savers in countries with weak local financial systems\n- Successful crypto protocols are building moats through:\n  - Economies of scale\n  - Network effects\n  - Coordinated resources\n  - Strong branding\n- Long-term investment strategy in crypto should focus on survival, incremental improvement, and building sustainable value"
