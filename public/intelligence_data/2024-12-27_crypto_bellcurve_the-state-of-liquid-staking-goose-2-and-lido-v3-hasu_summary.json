  "text": "Key Insight\nLido is transitioning from a single liquid staking product to a modular platform that enables customized staking products, addressing the fragmentation in the liquid staking ecosystem and meeting diverse institutional and reaking market demands.\n\nKey Insights\n- Liquid staking ecosystem has become more heterogeneous, with emerging segments like reaking and institutional staking\n- Lido is developing \"staking vaults\" to allow organizations to create personalized staking products while leveraging Lido's infrastructure and stETH liquidity\n- The protocol aims to create a market for validators with more flexible compensation based on different operational costs and decentralization contributions\n- Institutional adoption of liquid staking is growing, with an estimated 25% of stETH users already being institutions\n- Lido is focusing on becoming the primary collateral in reaking rather than creating a separate liquid restaking token\n- The protocol is preparing to implement dual governance, which will give token holders explicit rights to exit or pause the protocol\n- Ethereum's development is prioritizing incremental L1 improvements and supporting L2 growth, with a focus on user experience and application development\n- The project is cautious about returning capital to token holders, believing reinvestment in protocol development is more critical at this stage\n"
