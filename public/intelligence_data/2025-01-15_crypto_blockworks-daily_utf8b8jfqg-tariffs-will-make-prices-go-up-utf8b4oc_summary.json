  "text": "Synopsis\nTariffs are not inherently inflationary, contrary to popular belief, as they represent a one-time price increase that does not fundamentally alter the money supply, which is the true driver of sustained inflation.\n\nKey Insights\n- Milton Friedman defined inflation as \"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\" - specifically a steady and sustained rise in prices driven by money supply growth\n- Tariffs create a one-time price increase in specific goods, which does not constitute true inflation\n- The Federal Reserve controls inflation primarily through money supply management, not through responding to individual price shocks\n- Economist John Cochrane argues that supply shocks (like tariffs) only cause overall inflation if monetary and fiscal policy respond by increasing demand\n- Tariffs may actually be deflationary if they generate additional government revenue that helps pay down debt without increasing money supply\n- Federal Reserve Chair Powell discusses inflation in terms of multiple economic indicators, but ultimately, long-term price increases are fundamentally linked to money supply expansion\n- The key mechanism of inflation is more money chasing the same amount of goods, diluting purchasing power"
