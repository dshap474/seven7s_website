  "text": "Synopsis\nUnion is developing a highly decentralized, secure, and gas-efficient interoperability protocol using zero-knowledge light clients that aims to enable seamless, low-cost cross-chain transactions with near-instant finality.\n\nKey Insights\n- Union's core innovation is a decentralized interoperability layer that connects different blockchains without relying on centralized oracles or multi-sig setups\n- The protocol uses zero-knowledge light clients to verify cross-chain transactions, with a unique ZK-powered consensus verification mechanism\n- Key architectural features include:\n  - Constant gas costs for adding new blockchain connections\n  - Ability to aggregate proofs across multiple chains\n  - Solver network that can dynamically optimize transfer times and costs\n- Planned mainnet launch in the current year, with the largest trust setup ceremony to date (around 600 GB)\n- Long-term vision is to move away from intent-based bridges to proof-based bridging with sub-second finality\n- Supports advanced use cases like cross-chain DEXs, private intents, and confidential clearing layers\n- Addresses current interoperability challenges of high fees, slow transfers, and complex blockchain interactions\n- Targeting a future of modular, on-demand rollups with seamless cross-chain communication"
