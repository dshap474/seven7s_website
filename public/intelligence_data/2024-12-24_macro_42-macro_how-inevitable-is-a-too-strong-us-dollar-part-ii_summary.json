  "text": "Key Insight\nThe US dollar is likely to remain strong in the medium term due to widening interest rate differentials and potential policy changes, with a significant Treasury General Account spend-down potentially creating a global refinancing challenge.\n\nKey Insights\n- Multiple factors are expected to support the current US dollar uptrend, including:\n  1. Widening interest rate differentials\n  2. Potential implementation of tariffs\n- A projected $700-$800 billion Treasury General Account (TGA) spend-down is anticipated in early next year\n- The TGA spend-down could be dollar-bearish and support risk assets through late Q1 or early Q2\n- Subsequent TGA replenishment may create a global refinancing \"air pocket\" with limited dollar balance sheet capacity\n- Potential shifts in US net financing policy under incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\n"
