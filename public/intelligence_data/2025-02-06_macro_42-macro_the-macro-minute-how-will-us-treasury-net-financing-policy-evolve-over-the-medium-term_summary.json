  "title": "The Macro Minute: How will US Treasury net financing policy evolve over the medium term?",
  "text": "Synopsis\nThe US Treasury's net financing policy is expected to remain stable in the near term, with Secretary Scott Bessent likely to maintain current coupon auction sizes and wait for legislative outcomes before making significant changes.\n\nKey Insights\n- US Treasury Q1 quarterly refunding announcement suggests a delay in a potentially hawkish pivot in net financing policy\n- Incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appears more moderate than initially expected, contrary to his previous critical stance\n- Treasury plans to maintain or even reduce coupon auction sizes for several upcoming quarters\n- Potential for increased bond supply later in the year or early next year, contingent on deficit reduction\n- Approximately $500 billion of debt ceiling-induced Treasury General Account (TGA) spending expected in the next few months\n- Current liquidity conditions remain positive for asset markets\n- Credit spreads are historically tight (in the second percentile since the late 1980s)\n- Growing private credit market may obscure some traditional credit market indicators\n- The US economy continues to show resilience, contrary to bearish market expectations"
