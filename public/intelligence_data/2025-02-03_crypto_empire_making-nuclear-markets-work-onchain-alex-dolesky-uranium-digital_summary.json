  "text": "Synopsis\nUranium Digital is building the first comprehensive spot market for uranium on Solana, aiming to transform the historically opaque uranium trading landscape by providing institutional-grade infrastructure that enables more efficient, transparent, and accessible uranium trading.\n\nKey Insights\n- Uranium currently powers 10% of global electricity through nuclear reactors, with significant projected growth driven by AI data centers and global electrification needs\n- Current uranium market is highly inefficient, with trading primarily occurring through private bilateral deals and long-term 10-year contracts\n- The global uranium market turns over approximately 190 million pounds annually, but only produces 140-145 million pounds, creating a significant supply-demand imbalance\n- Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are expected to revolutionize nuclear energy, with potential construction times reduced to 1-3 years compared to traditional 15-year reactor development cycles\n- By 2050, 31 countries have agreed to triple nuclear capacity, with the International Energy Agency recommending doubling capacity to meet climate goals\n- Data centers are projected to require more electricity than entire countries, with potential electricity demand exceeding Japan's by end of 2026\n- Uranium Digital chose Solana for its platform due to low transaction costs, high performance, and institutional-friendly infrastructure\n- The platform will initially focus on institutional traders, with 100,000-pound minimum lot sizes, and plans to expand into derivatives and other financial products"
