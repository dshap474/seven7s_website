Key Insight
The US dollar is likely to remain strong due to widening interest rate differentials, potential tariffs, and complex treasury dynamics, with a potential temporary bearish period due to Treasury General Account spending in early 2025.


<list_of_important_information>
- The US dollar is expected to maintain an uptrend over the medium term
- Key drivers of dollar strength include:
  1. Widening interest rate differentials
  2. Potential implementation of tariffs
- A significant $700-800 billion Treasury General Account (TGA) spend-down is anticipated in early 2025
- This TGA spend-down could temporarily:
  - Weaken the dollar
  - Support risk assets through late Q1 or early Q2 2025
- Subsequent TGA replenishment may create a global refinancing "air pocket"
- The incoming Treasury Secretary (Scott Bessent) is expected to shift US net financing policy
- The Federal Reserve is implementing "Fake QT" by allowing maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet without actively selling bonds
- This approach has contributed to:
  - A more resilient economy
  - Buoyant asset prices
  - Maintained labor market strength
