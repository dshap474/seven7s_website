  "text": "Synopsis\nEthereum is underperforming Bitcoin due to institutional uncertainty, driven by its lack of a clear, consistent value proposition and ongoing inflationary concerns, which contrasts with Bitcoin's established narrative as digital gold with a predictable four-year cycle.\n\nKey Insights\n- Bitcoin has a more predictable investment cycle centered around halving events, making it more attractive to institutional investors\n- Ethereum lacks a succinct positioning strategy, with multiple competing narratives (ultrasound money, decentralized computer, store of value)\n- Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum are viewed as potentially positive for ecosystem development, but do not fundamentally resolve the core valuation challenges\n- Ethereum's potential inflationary nature is a significant deterrent for institutional investment vehicles\n- Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet seen widespread institutional investment vehicles like those created by MicroStrategy\n- The ongoing uncertainty around Ethereum's long-term value proposition is negatively impacting its price performance relative to Bitcoin\n- Cross-chain interoperability and L2 decentralization will be critical factors in Ethereum's future institutional adoption"
