  "text": "Synopsis\nThe US fiscal policy under a potential Trump administration may involve significant spending cuts (Doge process) and tax reforms, but is unlikely to dramatically reduce the budget deficit, potentially maintaining economic uncertainty and market volatility.\n\nKey Insights\n- US currently tracking budget deficits at approximately -7% of nominal GDP in a fully employed economy\n- Potential deficit reduction might only bring the deficit down to around -5% of GDP\n- Trump's five policy platforms include two potentially negative supply shock elements: tariffs and border security\n- Positive supply shock elements include tax cuts, deregulation, and spending cuts (Doge process)\n- Four major budget categories (Medicare, Social Security, National Defense, and Interest) have been compounding at 15% annually\n- Stabilizing the budget would require cutting the remaining 35% of federal budget significantly\n- Tax cuts may not necessarily reduce deficits, based on previous experience with Trump-era tax cuts\n- Potential economic policy may involve balancing spending cuts with tax reforms\n- Geopolitical and economic uncertainty remains high, with potential for increased defense spending due to \"Fourth Turning\" dynamics\n- US dollar strength has been surprisingly weak, with the Dollar Index down 1% despite supportive economic indicators"
